					<h3>Welcome</h3>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Overview of this class</li>
							<li>Review tentative schedule</li>
							<li>Q &amp; A</li>
							<li>Entrance survey (emailed to everyone this morning)</li>
						</ul>
					</p>				

					<h3>Some goals for this semester</h3>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Continue building upon core coding skills in order to get to a place where you feel like the tech can take a back seat to your ideas.</li>
							<li>Become familiar with current network technologies commonly used in interaction design/arts-engineering practices (OSC and SpaceBrew, specifically)</li>
							<li>Create spatial experiences with encourage communication and interaction between people.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>Be serious, not solemn</h3>

						<p>Paula Scher TED talk</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>"Being solemn is easy. Being serious is hard. Children almost always begin by being serious, which is what makes them so entertaining when compared with adults as a class. Adults, on the whole, are solemn.</p>

							<p>That’s because it is hard for most people to recognize seriousness, which is rare, but more comfortable to endorse solemnity, which is commonplace.</p>

							<p>Solemn design is often important and very effective design. Solemn design is also socially correct, and is accepted by appropriate audiences. It’s what right-thinking designers and all the clients are striving for. Serious design, serious play, is something else. For one thing, it often happens spontaneously, intuitively, accidentally or incidentally. It can be achieved out of innocence, or arrogance, or out of selfishness, sometimes out of carelessness. But mostly, it’s achieved through all those kind of crazy parts of human behavior that don’t really make any sense.</p>

							<p>Serious design is imperfect. It’s filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being the first of its kind. Serious design is also — often — quite unsuccessful from the solemn point of view. That’s because the art of serious play is about invention, change, rebellion — not perfection. Perfection happens during solemn play."</p>

					<h3>More poetry, less demos</h3>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							"The main challenge is trying to create work that touches people at an emotional level, as opposed to them thinking about the technology or wondering how it was made. Making poems, not demos, is how we refer to it, i.e. making work that is like a poem, short yet dense, re-tellable, rhythmic, meaningful as opposed to a demo that just feels like technology for technology's sake."

					<h3>"The Gauntlet"</h3>
					<p>
						We'll be starting the semester with the expectation that everyone is coming to this class with some basic understanding of code (and the assumption that this is likely Processing).
					</p>
					<p>
						For homework, I would like you to make a small Processing sketch which demonstrates something you find interesting about code as a material. For instance, this might be some sort of drawing machine, interactive toy, a simple game, a noise maker, a video sequencer, etc. You decide.
					</p>
					<p>
						Next week, we'll begin looking at a very handy network protocol called OSC and experimenting with different ways of connecting these sketches together to have mutual influence over one another. 
					</p>
					<p> Try to incorporate the following, if possible (don't worry too much if you're not able to use them all):
						<ul>
							<li>Variables</li>
							<li>Mouse or keyboard input</li>
							<li>Array or ArrayList</li>
							<li>'else if' conditional statements</li>
							<li>Conditional operators like && or ||</li>
							<li>Custom function with argument(s)</li>
							<li>Custom function which returns a value other than void</li>
							<li>Custom class (Object)</li>
							<li>A multimedia library like Video, Minim, or libPd</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h3>Don't panic!</h3>
					<p>
						This is not a test. The goal is twofold:
						<ul>
							<li>To establish where you all are with these things.</li>
							<li>To give us some material to break apart next week.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="homework">
					<h3>Reading 1: The Critical Engineering Manifesto</h3>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Choose one of the bullet points that you find interesting (you can agree or disagree with the statement).</li>
							<li>Be prepared to share your thoughts in class next week.</li>
						</ul>
