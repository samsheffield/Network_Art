					<h3>OSC Interfaces</h3>
					<p>
						OSC is not only a great network protocol, it is also a handy way of connecting various pieces of software together. Today, we'll start by looking at using OSC as a means of quickly expanding our range of possible inputs with things like...
					</p>

					<h3>Touch interfaces (smartphone/tablet)</h3>

					<h3>Face tracking</h3>

					<h3>A better working environment</h3>
					<p>You'll notice that I don't use the Processing IDE to demonstrate examples in class. There's a good reason for that... <em>it's awful!</em></p>	
					<p>My current setup:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text 2</a> ($70, but also sort of free)</li>
						<li><a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/installation#st2">Package Control</a> (needed to install Processing package)</li>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/b-g/processing-sublime">processing-sublime package</a> (code completion, coloring, and building)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>I'm happy to help set this up if you want to work with something other than the Processing IDE. Oh, and ⌘B runs the sketch from Sublime Text (not ⌘R).</p>

					<h3>The OSC protocol</h3>	
					<blockquote>"Open Sound Control (OSC) is an open, transport-independent, message-based protocol developed for communication among computers, sound synthesizers, and other multimedia devices."
					<cite>The Open Sound Control 1.0 Specification</cite>
					</blockquote>	
					<ul>
						<li>OSC stands for Open Sound Control, but it's not just for sound!</li>
						<li>It is a highly flexible and reliable protocol which can be used to manage communication between computers over a network.</li>
						<li>OSC can also be used to communicate between different pieces of software on the same computer.</li>
						<li>OSC is built on top of another network protocol called UDP, which is meant for speed, not reliability.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>OSC applications (conversational models)</h3>

					<h3>Processing OSC library</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>You will need to install the oscP5 Processing library (<a href="http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/">available here</a>)</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Network setup</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Make sure we are all connected to the <em>exact same</em> MICA network.</li>
						<li>Know your current IP address (<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Find-Your-IP-Address-on-a-Mac">Mac instructions</a>) (<a href="https://kb.wisc.edu/page.php?id=27309">Windows instructions</a>) <em>Note: this will change if you leave the network and return later.</em></li>
						<li>If you are communicating between software on a single computer, your IP address will be 127.0.0.1</li>
						<li>Choose two ports (send &amp; receive) to communicate on. A list of commonly used network ports on Apple computers is <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1629">here</a>. <em>Note: this list is not exhaustive.</em></li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Example code</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>All example code from week 2 can be found <a href="https://github.com/samsheffield/Network_Art/releases/tag/week2s14">here</a>.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Getting our feet wet with OSC...</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Use the example (one_way_01) to send data in one direction between two sketches on a single computer.</li>
						<li>Use 127.0.0.1 as the IP address.</li>
						<li>Templates are available in this week's code samples on Github. (linked above)</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Shallow end of the pool...</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Find a partner. (One group needs 3 people, unless someone is absent today)</li>
						<li>You will need their IP address.</li>
						<li>Modify the example to send data in one direction between your two computers.</li>
						<li>Add an additional message to send from one person to the other.</li>
						<li>3 person group: take turns <em>or</em> communicate between three computers</li>
					</ul>

					<img src="images/excorpse.jpg">
					<p class="subtitle"><em>Early exquisite cadaver drawing, 1920s</em> by Andre Breton and others</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Modify your homework so that it uses a float sent via OSC as input, and sends a float via OSC as output.</li>
						<li>Look at the back and forth example sketches (back_forth_02) to get a sense of all the parts needed to send <em>and</em> receive from a single sketch.</li>
						<li>You need to know the IP address and ports for the person before and after you in the chain. (Unless you are the start or finish of the chain)</li>
						<li>We will link up everyone no later than 2:00 this afternoon. Be sure to do some tests with your partner(s) beforehand.</li>

						<p>Paula Scher TED talk</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>"Being solemn is easy. Being serious is hard. Children almost always begin by being serious, which is what makes them so entertaining when compared with adults as a class. Adults, on the whole, are solemn.</p>

							<p>That’s because it is hard for most people to recognize seriousness, which is rare, but more comfortable to endorse solemnity, which is commonplace.</p>

							<p>Solemn design is often important and very effective design. Solemn design is also socially correct, and is accepted by appropriate audiences. It’s what right-thinking designers and all the clients are striving for. Serious design, serious play, is something else. For one thing, it often happens spontaneously, intuitively, accidentally or incidentally. It can be achieved out of innocence, or arrogance, or out of selfishness, sometimes out of carelessness. But mostly, it’s achieved through all those kind of crazy parts of human behavior that don’t really make any sense.</p>

							<p>Serious design is imperfect. It’s filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being the first of its kind. Serious design is also — often — quite unsuccessful from the solemn point of view. That’s because the art of serious play is about invention, change, rebellion — not perfection. Perfection happens during solemn play."</p>

					<h3>More poetry, less demos</h3>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							"The main challenge is trying to create work that touches people at an emotional level, as opposed to them thinking about the technology or wondering how it was made. Making poems, not demos, is how we refer to it, i.e. making work that is like a poem, short yet dense, re-tellable, rhythmic, meaningful as opposed to a demo that just feels like technology for technology's sake."

					<h3>"The Gauntlet"</h3>
					<p>
						We'll be starting the semester with the expectation that everyone is coming to this class with some basic understanding of code (and the assumption that this is likely Processing).
					</p>
					<p>
						For homework, I would like you to make a small Processing sketch which demonstrates something you find interesting about code as a material. For instance, this might be some sort of drawing machine, interactive toy, a simple game, a noise maker, a video sequencer, etc. You decide.
					</p>
					<p>
						Next week, we'll begin looking at a very handy network protocol called OSC and experimenting with different ways of connecting these sketches together to have mutual influence over one another. 
					</p>
					<p> Try to incorporate the following, if possible (don't worry too much if you're not able to use them all):
						<ul>
							<li>Variables</li>
							<li>Mouse or keyboard input</li>
							<li>Array or ArrayList</li>
							<li>'else if' conditional statements</li>
							<li>Conditional operators like && or ||</li>
							<li>Custom function with argument(s)</li>
							<li>Custom function which returns a value other than void</li>
							<li>Custom class (Object)</li>
							<li>A multimedia library like Video, Minim, or libPd</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h3>Don't panic!</h3>
					<p>
						This is not a test. The goal is twofold:
						<ul>
							<li>To establish where you all are with these things.</li>
							<li>To give us some material to break apart next week.</li>
						</ul>
